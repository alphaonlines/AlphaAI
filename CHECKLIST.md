# Executive Plan Alignment Checklist

- [ ] `ai-overview.html`: Apply the common template (hero + one-line purpose, ≤5-bullet quick summary, jump links, compare box “Who leads + why”, sources/date/change-log snippet).
- [ ] `infrastructure.html`: Same template; add Robotics & Autonomy as a prominent section; include update badge, jump links, compare box, sources/change-log.
- [ ] `research.html`: Add jump links, quick summary, dated change-log; link to the `Research` briefing and any new sources.
- [ ] `Research` briefing: Convert to an on-site page (e.g., `research-briefing.html`) or a `research.html` subsection; add nav/footer link.
- [ ] Nav/footer: Decide on adding “Research Briefing” and/or “Sources/Glossary” links; enforce consistency across pages.
- [ ] Accessibility/UX: Consider A-/A+ text toggle, confirm high contrast, keep sticky nav, add back-to-top on all pages.
- [ ] Sources hygiene: Add dated citations per page; surface publication dates near links.
- [ ] Change logs: Add “Last updated” badges and 2–3 bullet change logs on every page.
- [ ] Print/PDF: Add print-friendly styles for executive downloads.
- [ ] Client-side search (optional): Lightweight keyword search or filter for terms/sections.
- [ ] Testing: Smoke-test desktop/mobile, verify nav anchors/jump links, confirm Chart.js still loads on `ai-overview.html`.
