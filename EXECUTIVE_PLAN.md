# Executive-Friendly Site Plan

Yep — here’s a simple, executive-friendly plan for the site so an older (but curious) reader can get caught up fast without feeling lost.

1) Goal + “reader path” (make it dead simple)

Design the site around 3 fast choices on every page:

“Catch me up in 5 minutes” (TL;DR bullets)

“Go deeper” (expandable sections / longer bullets)

“Show me the sources” (links + dates)

That keeps it useful for both quick skimming and real learning.

2) Sitemap (keep nav small, predictable)

Top navigation (max 5–6 items):

Home (index.html) – what this is, how to use it, last updated, quick start

AI Leaders (ai-overview.html) – foundation model labs + major apps/ecosystems

Infrastructure (infrastructure.html) – chips, cloud, networking, data centers, tooling

Robotics & Autonomy (could be a section on infrastructure.html or a dedicated page later)

Research Log (research.html) – dated notes, benchmarks, links, “what changed”

Glossary / Sources (optional but hugely helpful for non-technical readers)

If you want to stick to your 4-page structure, put Robotics as a big section inside Infrastructure, and tuck Glossary + Sources into the footer of every page.

3) Home page layout (what your boss sees first)

Above the fold (no scrolling needed to know what to do):

Title: “AI Landscape — Executive Brief”

One-sentence purpose

Three big buttons:

“Start with the AI Leaders”

“Understand the Infrastructure”

“Read the 5-Minute History of AI”

A small “Last Updated: Dec 4, 2025” badge

A small disclaimer: Directional info / not investment advice

Then sections:

5-minute AI timeline (1950s → deep learning → transformers → today)

What happened in the last 12 months (headline bullets)

How to use this site (one short paragraph)

4) Page template (use the same pattern everywhere)

For each page, keep the structure consistent:

Header: Page title + one-line “what you’ll learn”

Quick Summary (5 bullets max) — the “executive skim”

Jump Links (sticky): Leaders / Trends / Risks / Lookups / Sources

Main Content: short sections with scannable bullets

Compare box: “Who leads + why” (2–6 bullets)

Bottom: Sources + last updated + change log snippet

Consistency is what makes it feel “easy.”

5) Company cards (make them readable + comparable)

Use a repeatable “card” format for every company so the brain doesn’t work hard:

What they are (1 line)

Why they matter (1–2 bullets)

Products / models (bullets)

Money context (market cap if public / valuation + funding if private, with date)

Last 12 months (2–4 bullets with dates)

Watchlist (1–2 bullets: risks, moats, catalysts)

Links (official + 1–3 reputable sources)

This is the difference between “Wikipedia chaos” and “executive briefing.”

6) UX features that help older readers

These are small touches that make the site feel polished:

Large default font (and a simple A- / A+ text size toggle)

High contrast colors

Lots of spacing (no dense paragraphs)

Sticky top nav

“Back to top” button

Print-friendly mode (executives love printing / PDF)

Client-side search (even a simple keyword search helps a ton)

Glossary popouts for terms like: “GPU”, “token”, “fine-tuning”, “inference”

7) “Update hygiene” (keeps it trustworthy)

Every page should show:

Last updated date

What changed (3 bullets)

Sources (links + publication dates)

That prevents it from feeling like random internet opinions.

8) Suggested content flow (what order to build)

Home: framing + timeline + “how to read”

AI Leaders: top labs + top platforms + quick comparison

Infrastructure: Nvidia/AMD/TSMC + hyperscalers + networking + data

Research Log: dated entries + benchmarks + “things to verify”
